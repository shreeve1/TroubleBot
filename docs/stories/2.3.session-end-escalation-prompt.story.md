# Story 2.3: Session-End Escalation Prompt

## Status
Approved

## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack Context
- **UI Component Library**: Headless UI ~2.0.4 for unstyled, accessible components [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 for utility-first styling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js ~14.2.3 for React framework [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **State Management**: React Hooks & Context ~18.3.1 for local state [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure Requirements
- Components in apps/web/components/ [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Pages in apps/web/pages/ [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Modal component already exists in apps/web/components/ui/Modal.tsx [Source: stories/2.1.styled-ui-component-library.story.md]

### Testing Standards
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest & React Testing Library ~29.7.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright ~1.44.1 for modal interaction testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Multi-layered strategy following "testing pyramid" [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### File Locations
- apps/web/pages/index.tsx: Main chat interface (needs modification)
- apps/web/components/ui/Modal.tsx: Existing modal component
- apps/web/components/ui/Button.tsx: Existing button component
- apps/web/__tests__/index.test.tsx: Frontend tests (needs updates)

### Technical Constraints
- No authentication required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- No database required (stateless) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Components must be accessible [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must maintain existing chat functionality
- Modal should not interfere with ongoing chat

### Previous Story Insights
- Styled UI component library fully implemented [Source: stories/2.1.styled-ui-component-library.story.md]
- Full UI design applied to main screen [Source: stories/2.2.apply-full-ui-design.story.md]
- Core AI integration functional [Source: stories/1.5.core-ai-integration.story.md]
- Modal component already exists and is tested
- Professional chat interface with enhanced UX features

### Design Considerations
- "End Session" button should be prominently placed but not intrusive
- Modal should clearly explain what escalation means and its implications
- Button placement should follow existing UI patterns
- Modal content should be concise but informative
- Consider adding a confirmation step for "Yes" to prevent accidental escalation

### Accessibility Requirements
- Modal must be keyboard accessible (Tab, Escape, Enter)
- Focus must be trapped within modal when open
- Focus must be restored to trigger element when modal closes
- Screen reader announcements for modal state changes
- High contrast and clear visual hierarchy
