# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

FR1: The system must provide a web-based chat interface for the user.

FR2: The AI's behavior and troubleshooting logic must be governed by a pre-loaded, static instruction file.

FR3: The system shall not require any user login or authentication to start a session.

FR4: The chat history must be visible to the user during an active session.

FR5: The chat history must be cleared when the user's session ends (e.g., the browser tab is closed).

FR6: At the end of a chat session, the system must explicitly ask the user if the issue is being escalated.

FR7: If the user confirms escalation, the system must generate a condensed, summarized version of the troubleshooting steps taken.

FR8: The user must be able to easily copy the condensed transcript for use in another system (e.g., a ticketing system).

## Non-Functional Requirements

NFR1: The front-end user interface must be implemented based on the provided Figma design template.

NFR2: The application must be containerized using Docker for deployment.

NFR3: The core AI logic must be powered by the Gemini model.

NFR4: The system's chat responses should be delivered in a timely manner to maintain a conversational feel.

### Security & Compliance

NFR5: API Security: The public-facing serverless API endpoint must be protected from denial-of-service and abuse through rate limiting and other standard security measures.

NFR6: Data in Transit Security: All communication between the user's browser, the serverless backend, and the Gemini API must be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.

NFR7: Data Privacy and Ephemerality: The service must not persist any user chat logs. All conversation data must be handled only in memory for the duration of the session and for the generation of the transcript, after which it must be discarded.

### Reliability & Availability

NFR8: Graceful API Error Handling: The user interface must gracefully handle errors from the backend or the Gemini API. If a connection fails, a user-friendly message (e.g., "I'm sorry, I'm unable to connect at the moment. Please try again.") must be displayed instead of a technical error or an application crash.

NFR9: Service Availability: The service should target a 99.5% uptime for its core functionality.
