1. Goals and Background Context
Goals
Empower MSP technicians to solve problems faster.

Reduce distractions and the need for peer-to-peer interruptions.

Improve the efficiency and data fidelity of the ticket escalation process.

Enable the MSP business to scale and support more clients without a proportional increase in staff.

Background Context
This document outlines the requirements for a specialized web-based chatbot designed to improve the productivity of Managed Service Provider (MSP) technicians. Existing troubleshooting processes are hampered by inefficiencies, including technician distraction and information loss during ticket escalations. This tool will address these problems by providing a highly focused, AI-led diagnostic experience, guided by a pre-loaded instruction set. It will function as a dedicated productivity instrument, not a general-purpose AI, with key features like a smart escalation transcript to streamline the entire support lifecycle.

2. Requirements
Functional Requirements
FR1: The system must provide a web-based chat interface for the user.

FR2: The AI's behavior and troubleshooting logic must be governed by a pre-loaded, static instruction file.

FR3: The system shall not require any user login or authentication to start a session.

FR4: The chat history must be visible to the user during an active session.

FR5: The chat history must be cleared when the user's session ends (e.g., the browser tab is closed).

FR6: At the end of a chat session, the system must explicitly ask the user if the issue is being escalated.

FR7: If the user confirms escalation, the system must generate a condensed, summarized version of the troubleshooting steps taken.

FR8: The user must be able to easily copy the condensed transcript for use in another system (e.g., a ticketing system).

Non-Functional Requirements
NFR1: The front-end user interface must be implemented based on the provided Figma design template.

NFR2: The application must be containerized using Docker for deployment.

NFR3: The core AI logic must be powered by the Gemini model.

NFR4: The system's chat responses should be delivered in a timely manner to maintain a conversational feel.
Security & Compliance

NFR5: API Security: The public-facing serverless API endpoint must be protected from denial-of-service and abuse through rate limiting and other standard security measures.

NFR6: Data in Transit Security: All communication between the user's browser, the serverless backend, and the Gemini API must be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.

NFR7: Data Privacy and Ephemerality: The service must not persist any user chat logs. All conversation data must be handled only in memory for the duration of the session and for the generation of the transcript, after which it must be discarded.
Reliability & Availability

NFR8: Graceful API Error Handling: The user interface must gracefully handle errors from the backend or the Gemini API. If a connection fails, a user-friendly message (e.g., "I'm sorry, I'm unable to connect at the moment. Please try again.") must be displayed instead of a technical error or an application crash.

NFR9: Service Availability: The service should target a 99.5% uptime for its core functionality.

3. User Interface Design Goals
Overall UX Vision
The user experience will be minimalist, clean, and highly focused. The primary goal of the UI is to facilitate a smooth, linear conversation between the technician and the AI with zero unnecessary clutter or distractions. Every element should serve the core purpose of guiding the technician through troubleshooting steps efficiently.

Key Interaction Paradigms
The primary interaction paradigm is a conversational UI (chatbot). The flow will be AI-led, where the assistant proactively interviews the technician to diagnose the problem, rather than relying on the technician to ask all the questions.

Core Screens and Views
Main Troubleshooting Screen: The primary chat interface where the technician interacts with the AI.

Escalation Transcript View: A simple, clean view for displaying the condensed transcript, with an obvious "Copy to Clipboard" function.

Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, ensuring it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

Branding
All branding, including color palettes, typography, and logos, will be derived directly from the provided Figma design template.

Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application will be a responsive web app, fully functional on modern desktop browsers. The design should also be usable on a tablet.

4. Technical Assumptions
Repository Structure: Monorepo
A monorepo is recommended to simplify development and dependency management between the frontend web application and the backend service.

Service Architecture: Serverless
A serverless architecture (e.g., using a single cloud function) for the backend is ideal for scalability and cost-effectiveness.

Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration
The project will require both unit tests (for individual components/functions) and integration tests (to verify that the frontend and backend work together correctly).

Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
The application must be containerized using Docker.

The core AI logic must be powered by the Gemini model.

5. Epic List
Epic 1: Foundation & Core Chat Functionality

Goal: Establish the foundational project structure, CI/CD pipeline, and a core, functional chat interface that successfully communicates with the serverless AI backend.

Epic 2: UI Implementation & Smart Transcript Feature

Goal: Implement the full, pixel-perfect user interface from the Figma design and develop the critical "smart escalation transcript" feature, including the user prompt and summary generation.
