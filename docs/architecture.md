Of course. Here is the complete, compiled Fullstack Architecture Document we have created together.

Fullstack Architecture Document
Created by: Winston, the Architect

Introduction
The technical foundation for this project will be a standard Next.js project starter template, providing a production-ready starting point using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

High Level Architecture
Technical Summary
The application will be built using a Jamstack architecture. The frontend, built with Next.js, will be statically generated and served globally from an edge network for maximum performance. All dynamic functionality, including communication with the Gemini API, will be handled by a backend built with Serverless Functions. This approach creates a highly scalable, secure, and cost-effective system that is perfectly suited for a high-performance, stateless web application. The entire project will be managed within a single Monorepo to streamline development.

Platform and Infrastructure Choice
Platform: Vercel.

Key Services: Vercel Edge Network (for frontend hosting), Vercel Functions (for the serverless backend).

Deployment Regions: Global Edge Network (automatic).

Repository Structure
Structure: Monorepo.

Tool: Turborepo

Architectural Patterns
Jamstack: The core architectural style. This provides superior performance, security, and scalability by decoupling the frontend from the backend.

Serverless Functions: The backend will consist of ephemeral functions that execute on demand. This aligns with our goals for cost-effectiveness and scalability.

Component-Based UI: The frontend will be built with reusable React components to ensure a maintainable and modular codebase.

External APIs
Google Gemini API
Purpose: Serves as the core AI engine for the chatbot.

Documentation: https://ai.google.dev/docs

Authentication: API Key stored securely as a server-side environment variable.

Integration Notes: The Gemini Service component encapsulates all logic for this API.

Core Workflows
Diagrams exist for the two primary workflows:

Core Chat Loop (Request/Response): Shows the sequence of events when a user sends a message and receives a response, including error paths.

Transcript Generation: Shows the sequence when a user requests a smart transcript.

Database Schema
Not applicable. The application is stateless and uses no database.

Frontend Architecture
Organization: A standard Next.js src directory structure will be used (components, context, hooks, pages, services).

State Management: React's built-in Context API and hooks will be used.

Routing: Next.js's file-based router will be used. No protected routes are needed.

Services: A dedicated apiClient.ts service will encapsulate all fetch calls.

Backend Architecture
Organization: Serverless functions will be implemented as Next.js API Routes in pages/api/. Core logic will be abstracted into service modules (e.g., geminiService.ts).

Patterns: API routes will be thin controllers, with logic handled by services. try...catch blocks are mandatory for error handling.

Unified Project Structure
A monorepo structure managed by Turborepo will be used, with apps/web for the Next.js application and packages/ for shared code like TypeScript types.

Development Workflow
The local workflow uses pnpm for package management and pnpm dev to run the development server. The only required environment variable is GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY in apps/web/.env.local.

Deployment Architecture
A continuous deployment strategy using Vercel's native Git integration will be used. Pushes to branches create preview deployments; merges to main deploy to production. A CI pipeline will run tests and linting.

Security and Performance
Security: A strict Content Security Policy (CSP), IP-based rate limiting on APIs, and input validation will be implemented.

Performance: The application will be statically generated (SSG) and served from Vercel's Edge Network for maximum performance, targeting a First Contentful Paint of under 1.8 seconds.

Testing Strategy
A multi-layered strategy following the "testing pyramid" will be used, with Jest and React Testing Library for unit/component tests, and Playwright for a small number of critical end-to-end tests.

Coding Standards
Critical rules have been defined to enforce the monorepo structure, separation of concerns, and security best practices. Naming conventions are specified for consistency.

Error Handling Strategy
An end-to-end strategy is defined with a standardized JSON error format, and consistent try...catch patterns on both the frontend and backend to ensure issues are managed gracefully.

Monitoring and Observability
The integrated tools from Vercel (Analytics and Log Drains) will be used to monitor frontend Core Web Vitals, backend function health (invocations, latency, errors), and track runtime errors.

Of course. Here is the complete, compiled Fullstack Architecture Document we have created together.
