# Architectural Patterns

Jamstack: The core architectural style. This provides superior performance, security, and scalability by decoupling the frontend from the backend.

Serverless Functions: The backend will consist of ephemeral functions that execute on demand. This aligns with our goals for cost-effectiveness and scalability.

Component-Based UI: The frontend will be built with reusable React components to ensure a maintainable and modular codebase.
