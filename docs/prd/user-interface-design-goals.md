# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience will be minimalist, clean, and highly focused. The primary goal of the UI is to facilitate a smooth, linear conversation between the technician and the AI with zero unnecessary clutter or distractions. Every element should serve the core purpose of guiding the technician through troubleshooting steps efficiently.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

The primary interaction paradigm is a conversational UI (chatbot). The flow will be AI-led, where the assistant proactively interviews the technician to diagnose the problem, rather than relying on the technician to ask all the questions.

## Core Screens and Views

Main Troubleshooting Screen: The primary chat interface where the technician interacts with the AI.

Escalation Transcript View: A simple, clean view for displaying the condensed transcript, with an obvious "Copy to Clipboard" function.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, ensuring it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

## Branding

All branding, including color palettes, typography, and logos, will be derived directly from the provided Figma design template.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The application will be a responsive web app, fully functional on modern desktop browsers. The design should also be usable on a tablet.
