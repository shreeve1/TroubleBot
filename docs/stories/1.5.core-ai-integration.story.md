# Story 1.5: Core AI Integration

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the backend to process my message using the pre-loaded Gemini instruction set and return the AI's actual response,
**so that** I can interact with the specialized troubleshooting assistant.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The serverless function integrates with the Gemini API.
2. The function is configured with the static instruction prompt.
3. The user's message is passed to the Gemini API.
4. The AI's response is returned and displayed.

## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack Context
- **Backend Framework**: Next.js API Routes ~14.2.3 for serverless functions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 for type-safe serverless functions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **API Style**: REST / RPC-like for API communication [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **External APIs**: Gemini API for AI processing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Logging**: Vercel Log Drains for serverless function logs [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure Requirements
- API routes in apps/web/pages/api/ [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- No database required (stateless) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- No authentication required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Testing Standards
- **Backend Testing**: Jest ~29.7.0 for API testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright ~1.44.1 for AI conversation testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Multi-layered strategy following "testing pyramid" [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### File Locations
- apps/web/pages/api/chat.ts: AI chat endpoint
- apps/web/config/gemini.ts: Gemini API configuration
- apps/web/utils/ai.ts: AI processing utilities
- .env.local: Environment variables for API keys

### Technical Constraints
- Serverless functions must be stateless [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- No persistent data storage required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- External API integration with Gemini required
- Environment variables for API keys needed

### Previous Story Insights
- End-to-end connection between frontend and backend established
- API client utilities ready for integration
- Message display and input handling functional
