# Story 1.2: "Hello World" Serverless Deployment

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a basic serverless API endpoint deployed and accessible via a public URL,
**so that** I can confirm the backend deployment pipeline is working.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "hello world" serverless function is created.
2. Configuration files for deployment exist.
3. A script can deploy the function.
4. The deployed endpoint returns a 200 OK JSON response.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create Next.js API route structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Set up apps/web/pages/api/ directory
  - [x] Create hello-world API route handler
  - [x] Implement basic JSON response
- [x] Configure deployment settings (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create vercel.json configuration
  - [x] Set up environment variables if needed
  - [x] Configure build settings for API routes
- [x] Create deployment script (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add deploy script to package.json
  - [x] Configure Vercel CLI integration
  - [x] Set up deployment environment
- [x] Test deployed endpoint (AC: 4)
  - [x] Deploy to Vercel
  - [x] Verify endpoint returns 200 OK
  - [x] Confirm JSON response format
  - [x] Document the public URL

## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack Context
- **Backend Framework**: Next.js API Routes ~14.2.3 for serverless functions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 for type-safe serverless functions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **API Style**: REST / RPC-like for API communication [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **CI/CD**: Vercel CI/CD for deployment platform [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Logging**: Vercel Log Drains for serverless function logs [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure Requirements
- API routes located in apps/web/pages/api/ [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- No database required (stateless application) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- No authentication required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Testing Standards
- **Backend Testing**: Jest ~29.7.0 for API route testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright ~1.44.1 for endpoint testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Multi-layered strategy following "testing pyramid" [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### File Locations
- apps/web/pages/api/hello-world.ts: API route handler
- vercel.json: Deployment configuration
- apps/web/package.json: Deployment scripts
- apps/web/next.config.js: Next.js configuration

### Technical Constraints
- Serverless functions must be stateless [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- No persistent data storage required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Vercel platform integration for deployment [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Previous Story Insights
- Monorepo structure established with Turborepo
- Next.js application framework in place
- TypeScript configuration ready
