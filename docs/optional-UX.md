UI/UX Specification
Created by: Sally, the UX Expert

Overall UX Goals & Principles
Target User Personas: Primary is "The On-the-Clock Technician"; Secondary is "The Escalation Specialist".

Usability Goals: Efficiency of Use, Error Prevention, and Memorability.

Design Principles: 1. Clarity Above All; 2. Guided Focus; 3. Instantaneous Feedback.

Information Architecture (IA)
The application is a single-page experience with no traditional navigation, following a simple, linear path from start to resolution or escalation.

User Flows
The project has two critical user flows:

Successful Troubleshooting Session: The "happy path" where a technician resolves an issue and ends the session.

Escalation Transcript Generation: The path where a technician cannot resolve the issue and uses the core feature to generate a condensed transcript for a senior technician.

Wireframes & Mockups
Primary Design Files: The single source of truth for all visual design is the provided Figma file: https://www.figma.com/slides/kn8xAsBRN8nC7MxnXddHtL/GuruChat?t=SDSo8tef8xsirqbo-6

Component Library / Design System
A "Figma-Driven" approach will be used. The component library will be a direct implementation of the reusable components defined in the Figma file. Core components include Chat Input, Send Button, Chat Bubble, Modal Dialog, and various buttons.

Branding & Style Guide
All branding and style information (colors, typography, spacing, iconography) will be derived directly from the Figma file.

Accessibility Requirements
The application will be designed and developed to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at Level AA.

Responsiveness Strategy
A standard set of breakpoints (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop, Wide) will be used. The layout will be a single, centered, responsive column on all screen sizes.

Animation & Micro-interactions
Animations will be functional, subtle, and performant, respecting prefers-reduced-motion. Key animations include new message appearance and button feedback.

Performance Considerations
The application will target a First Contentful Paint (FCP) of under 1.8 seconds and be interactive in under 3 seconds. All UI interactions must provide feedback in under 100ms.

Introduction
The technical foundation for this project will be a standard Next.js project starter template, providing a production-ready starting point using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

High Level Architecture
The application will be built using a Jamstack architecture with a Next.js frontend served from Vercel's Edge Network and a backend of Serverless Functions. The project will be managed in a Monorepo using Turborepo. The chosen platform is Vercel.

Tech Stack
The definitive tech stack includes TypeScript, Next.js, React, Headless UI, Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright, Turborepo, Vercel for CI/CD, and Tailwind CSS. The project is stateless and requires no database or authentication.

Data Models
The core data model is the ChatMessage interface ({ sender: 'user' | 'ai'; content: string; timestamp: string; }), which will be shared between the frontend and backend.

API Specification
The API will consist of two POST endpoints defined in an OpenAPI 3.0 spec:

/api/chat: Submits conversation history and gets the next AI response.

/api/transcript: Submits a full chat history to generate a condensed transcript.

Components
The system is broken down into five logical components:

Frontend: Chat UI View, API Client Service

Backend: Chat API Endpoint, Transcript API Endpoint, Gemini Service

External APIs
The single external dependency is the Google Gemini API, which will be accessed via a secure API key stored as a server-side environment variable.

Core Workflows
The two primary workflows (Core Chat Loop and Transcript Generation) are documented with sequence diagrams showing the interaction between all internal and external components, including error handling paths.

Database Schema
Not applicable, as the application is stateless and uses no database.

Frontend Architecture
The frontend will follow a conventional Next.js structure. It will use React Context for simple state management, file-based routing, and a dedicated service layer for API communication.

Backend Architecture
The backend will use Next.js API Routes as serverless functions. Core logic will be encapsulated in a geminiService.ts module, keeping the API route handlers thin and acting as controllers. No database or auth layers are required.

Unified Project Structure
A detailed monorepo file structure has been defined, organized into apps/web, packages/shared-types, and packages/config directories.

Development Workflow
The local development workflow is defined with pnpm for package management and Turborepo for running scripts (pnpm dev). The only required environment variable is GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY.

Deployment Architecture
A continuous deployment strategy using Vercel's native Git integration will be used. Every push will create a preview deployment, and merges to main will deploy to production. A basic CI pipeline will run tests and linting before deployment.UI/UX Specification

A continuous deployment strategy using Vercel's native Git integration will be used. Every push will create a preview deployment, and merges to main will deploy to production. A basic CI pipeline will run tests and linting before deployment.UI/UX Specification

Overall UX Goals & Principles
Target User Personas: Primary is "The On-the-Clock Technician"; Secondary is "The Escalation Specialist".

Usability Goals: Efficiency of Use, Error Prevention, and Memorability.

Design Principles: 1. Clarity Above All; 2. Guided Focus; 3. Instantaneous Feedback.

Information Architecture (IA)
The application is a single-page experience with no traditional navigation, following a simple, linear path from start to resolution or escalation.

User Flows
The project has two critical user flows:

Successful Troubleshooting Session: The "happy path" where a technician resolves an issue and ends the session.

Escalation Transcript Generation: The path where a technician cannot resolve the issue and uses the core feature to generate a condensed transcript for a senior technician.

Wireframes & Mockups
Primary Design Files: The single source of truth for all visual design is the provided Figma file: https://www.figma.com/slides/kn8xAsBRN8nC7MxnXddHtL/GuruChat?t=SDSo8tef8xsirqbo-6

Component Library / Design System
A "Figma-Driven" approach will be used. The component library will be a direct implementation of the reusable components defined in the Figma file. Core components include Chat Input, Send Button, Chat Bubble, Modal Dialog, and various buttons.

Branding & Style Guide
All branding and style information (colors, typography, spacing, iconography) will be derived directly from the Figma file.

Accessibility Requirements
The application will be designed and developed to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at Level AA.

Responsiveness Strategy
A standard set of breakpoints (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop, Wide) will be used. The layout will be a single, centered, responsive column on all screen sizes.

Animation & Micro-interactions
Animations will be functional, subtle, and performant, respecting prefers-reduced-motion. Key animations include new message appearance and button feedback.

Performance Considerations
The application will target a First Contentful Paint (FCP) of under 1.8 seconds and be interactive in under 3 seconds. All UI interactions must provide feedback in under 100ms.

Introduction
The technical foundation for this project will be a standard Next.js project starter template, providing a production-ready starting point using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

High Level Architecture
The application will be built using a Jamstack architecture with a Next.js frontend served from Vercel's Edge Network and a backend of Serverless Functions. The project will be managed in a Monorepo using Turborepo. The chosen platform is Vercel.

Tech Stack
The definitive tech stack includes TypeScript, Next.js, React, Headless UI, Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright, Turborepo, Vercel for CI/CD, and Tailwind CSS. The project is stateless and requires no database or authentication.

Data Models
The core data model is the ChatMessage interface ({ sender: 'user' | 'ai'; content: string; timestamp: string; }), which will be shared between the frontend and backend.

API Specification
The API will consist of two POST endpoints defined in an OpenAPI 3.0 spec:

/api/chat: Submits conversation history and gets the next AI response.

/api/transcript: Submits a full chat history to generate a condensed transcript.

Components
The system is broken down into five logical components:

Frontend: Chat UI View, API Client Service

Backend: Chat API Endpoint, Transcript API Endpoint, Gemini Service

External APIs
The single external dependency is the Google Gemini API, which will be accessed via a secure API key stored as a server-side environment variable.

Core Workflows
The two primary workflows (Core Chat Loop and Transcript Generation) are documented with sequence diagrams showing the interaction between all internal and external components, including error handling paths.

Database Schema
Not applicable, as the application is stateless and uses no database.

Frontend Architecture
The frontend will follow a conventional Next.js structure. It will use React Context for simple state management, file-based routing, and a dedicated service layer for API communication.

Backend Architecture
The backend will use Next.js API Routes as serverless functions. Core logic will be encapsulated in a geminiService.ts module, keeping the API route handlers thin and acting as controllers. No database or auth layers are required.

Unified Project Structure
A detailed monorepo file structure has been defined, organized into apps/web, packages/shared-types, and packages/config directories.

Development Workflow
The local development workflow is defined with pnpm for package management and Turborepo for running scripts (pnpm dev). The only required environment variable is GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY.
