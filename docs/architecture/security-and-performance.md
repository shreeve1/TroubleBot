# Security and Performance

Security: A strict Content Security Policy (CSP), IP-based rate limiting on APIs, and input validation will be implemented.

Performance: The application will be statically generated (SSG) and served from Vercel's Edge Network for maximum performance, targeting a First Contentful Paint of under 1.8 seconds.
