Project Brief
Created by: Analyst Mary

Executive Summary
This project brief outlines the development of a specialized web-based chatbot designed to enhance the productivity of Managed Service Provider (MSP) technicians. The application will function as a focused troubleshooting assistant, guided by a pre-loaded, unchangeable instruction set to ensure all interactions are strictly related to technical problem-solving. By eliminating distractions and automating parts of the workflow, such as creating smart escalation transcripts and integrating with ticketing systems, the chatbot's primary goal is to reduce issue resolution times. The key value proposition is to empower MSPs to scale their business and support a larger client base without a proportional increase in technician headcount.

Problem Statement
MSP technicians often lose valuable time to distractions or by interrupting senior colleagues for assistance with common issues. This reduces overall team efficiency and can prolong ticket resolution times. Furthermore, when an issue needs to be escalated, the manual process of writing detailed notes is time-consuming and can lead to a critical loss of information, forcing the escalation technician to start from scratch. These inefficiencies create a bottleneck that directly hinders the MSP's ability to scale its operations and take on more clients.

Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a single-purpose, web-based chatbot that acts as a first-line troubleshooting partner for MSP technicians. Its behavior is strictly defined by a built-in instruction file that guides the technician through a structured, AI-led "interview" process.

Key differentiators include:

An ephemeral, session-only chat history to maintain focus.

A "smart escalation transcript" feature that intelligently condenses the troubleshooting session into actionable notes for the next technician.

A user experience that requires no login, providing immediate access and utility.

This tool will succeed by being a specialized instrument, not a general-purpose tool, directly targeting the core workflow inefficiencies of an MSP technician.

Target Users
Primary User Segment: Tier 1 MSP technicians who perform the initial troubleshooting on support tickets. They need a tool that provides immediate, structured guidance to solve problems faster and more autonomously.

Secondary User Segment: Tier 2 (Escalation) technicians who receive complex tickets. They will benefit from the high-fidelity "smart transcripts," allowing them to understand the issue and prior actions instantly, thus reducing their own resolution time.

Goals & Success Metrics
Business Objectives

Enable the business to scale and support more clients with the same number of staff.

User Success Metrics

A measurable reduction in the average time-to-resolution for Tier 1 support tickets.

A reduction in the frequency of Tier 1 technicians interrupting peers for assistance.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Decrease: Average ticket resolution time.

Increase: Percentage of tickets resolved by Tier 1 without human assistance.

Decrease: Time spent by Tier 1 technicians writing escalation notes.

MVP Scope
Core Features (Must Have)

A web-based chat interface built from the provided Figma design.

An AI engine powered by the Gemini model and the pre-loaded instruction set.

The AI-led interview workflow as the primary interaction model.

A temporary, session-only chat history that is cleared when the session ends.

An end-of-session prompt asking the user if the issue is being escalated.

Generation of a condensed "smart transcript" for escalated issues.

Out of Scope for MVP

Direct integration with the ConnectWise Manage ticketing system.

Multiple AI personalities or tones.

Persistent, cross-session chat history.

User accounts or logins.

Post-MVP Vision
Phase 2 Features: Integrate directly with ConnectWise Manage to automatically create and update tickets with the smart transcript. Explore integration with remote access tools to suggest or run diagnostic commands.

Long-term Vision: Evolve the tool into a central knowledge and workflow engine for the MSP's entire support operation, potentially including training and onboarding modules.

Technical Considerations
Platform Requirements: The application must be a responsive web app.

Technology Preferences: The AI backend must use the Gemini model. The entire application will be containerized using Docker.

Architecture Considerations: The solution is stateless from the user's perspective (no login required). The core instruction set is a static, built-in asset.

Constraints & Assumptions
Constraints

The chatbot's purpose is fixed and cannot be adapted by the end-user.

The front-end must adhere to the provided Figma design.

Key Assumptions

An AI-led, structured interview process will be more effective for this use case than an open-ended conversational AI.

The Gemini model is capable of accurately condensing a troubleshooting conversation into a useful summary.

Risks & Open Questions
Key Risks

The effectiveness of the entire application is highly dependent on the quality and clarity of the core instruction file.

The "smart transcript" feature represents a significant technical challenge in accurately summarizing technical conversations.

Open Questions

What is the ideal format and level of detail for the condensed escalation transcript?

What are the specific API capabilities of ConnectWise Manage for a potential Phase 2 integration?Project Brief
