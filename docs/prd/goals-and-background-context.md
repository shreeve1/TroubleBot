## Background Context

This document outlines the requirements for a specialized web-based chatbot designed to improve the productivity of Managed Service Provider (MSP) technicians. Existing troubleshooting processes are hampered by inefficiencies, including technician distraction and information loss during ticket escalations. This tool will address these problems by providing a highly focused, AI-led diagnostic experience, guided by a pre-loaded instruction set. It will function as a dedicated productivity instrument, not a general-purpose AI, with key features like a smart escalation transcript to streamline the entire support lifecycle.
