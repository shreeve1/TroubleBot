## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack Context
- **Build Tool**: Turborepo ~2.0.1 for high-performance monorepo management [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js ~14.2.3 for the web application [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 for both frontend and backend [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 for styling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure Requirements
- Monorepo structure managed by Turborepo [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- apps/web for the Next.js application
- packages/ for shared code like TypeScript types
- No database required (stateless application) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Testing Standards
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest & React Testing Library ~29.7.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Testing**: Jest ~29.7.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright ~1.44.1 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Multi-layered strategy following "testing pyramid" [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### File Locations
- Root: turbo.json, package.json
- apps/web/: Next.js application
- packages/shared/: Shared TypeScript types
- .gitignore: Git ignore patterns

### Technical Constraints
- No authentication required (simplifies application) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- No database required (stateless application) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- CI/CD: Vercel CI/CD for deployment [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
